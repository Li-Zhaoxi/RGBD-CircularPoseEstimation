# RGBD-CircularPoseEstimation
Pose Estimation of Unknown Circular Object

**We have published all of datasets, you can download from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1g_EgnsU0ELYuUbFLhzkjlg with the code iyeh**

This project includes almost all of the details of our work about circular pose estimation on RGB-D images, such as: the source codes of our method, Blender and physical projects, label tool, seven datasets, evaluation tool, and some experimental scripts.

I will spend a few weeks supplementing the instructions of our project. 

## 1. Compile project
